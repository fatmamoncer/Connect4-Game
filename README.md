# Connect4

Connect Four is a classic two-player board game where the goal is to be the first to get four of your colored discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a grid. Players take turns dropping one of their discs from the top into one of the columns, and the disc will fall to the lowest available position in that column. The game continues until one player successfully connects four discs in a row or the grid is completely filled, resulting in a draw. It's a fun and strategic game that requires planning and skill to outsmart your opponent. You can find a simple implementation of Connect Four on GitHub to play and even customize for your own purposes.
